### Goals :-

1. **Apply everything learned in React**
   - Use of components, state, effects (`useEffect`), and routing (React Router).
   - Organize files and folders in a professional structure.
   - Handle data, functions, and props efficiently.
2. **Build a real-world E-commerce project**
   - Practice creating multiple pages (Products, Details, Cart, Login, etc.).
   - Design and implement a realistic user experience.
   - Prepare for the job market with a portfolio-ready project.

###  **Technologies & Concepts Used** :-

1. **React** â€“ For building reusable components and managing the UI.
2. **React Router DOM (v6/v7)** â€“ For page navigation and routing.
3. **useState & useEffect** â€“ For handling state and side effects.
4. **Props & Component Reusability** â€“ To pass data and build modular UI.
5. **Conditional Rendering** â€“ For dynamic UI behavior.
6. **Form Handling** â€“ For login, registration, and checkout forms.
7. **Local Storage** â€“ To store user/cart data locally.
8. **Tailwind CSS** â€“ For fast and responsive styling.
9. **JSX & Component Structure** â€“ To write HTML-like syntax and organize components.
10. **Basic Validation** â€“ To validate user inputs in forms.
11. **Routing Params (`useParams`)** â€“ To fetch and show product details.
12. **Fake Product Data (JSON)** â€“ For simulating products without backend.
13. **Responsive Design** â€“ To support both desktop and mobile views.
14. Backend or fake API integration with `axios`
15. **Redux (optional)** â€“ For advanced state management (e.g., cart/user).
16. **Testing (after finishing the app)** â€“ To ensure the app works as expected and is bug-free.
